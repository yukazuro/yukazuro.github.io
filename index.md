## About me
I'm Zoey, an 18yr old Australian developer. I have learning dificulties and may act a little differently to others, please don't discriminate or be mean, as I'm still a person.  

I've got 2 months of node.js and Python experience, working on Discord bots and website back-end, as well as a little design. I don't have a job yet, and I'm single. No ideas though, haha!  

My timezone is GMT +11 (AEDT), and I'm usually online from 9-10:00am to 5:00pm, unless something happens.  

If you'd like me to come join your own team or would like me to create you a website/bot, contact me. I won't bite :)
